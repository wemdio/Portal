"""Wipe PENDING Task rows left over from the pre-lazy scheduler.

Old rows carry ``public_id`` in their payload and ``scheduled_at`` values
from the previous run — if the daemon was offline for a while, they all
become "ready" at once and burst-fire under the new lazy semantics. Drop
them so the new planner builds a fresh 24h Poisson-spaced window on the
next reconcile cycle. RUNNING/COMPLETED/FAILED rows are kept as history.
